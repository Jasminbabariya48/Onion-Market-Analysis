# Onion-Market-Analysis

Why this Project?
Answer:---Due to recent government restrictions on onion exports, onion prices have significantly decreased, causing substantial losses for many farmers and commodity brokers. To address this issue, a project has been initiated to analyze the trend of onion prices across India and implement an ARIMA model to predict future prices accurately.
